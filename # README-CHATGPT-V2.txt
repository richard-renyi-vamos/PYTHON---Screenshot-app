Sure, here's an example of a Python script using the pyautogui and tkinter libraries to take a screenshot and create a GUI with a button to keep the window always on top:

python
Copy code
import pyautogui
import tkinter as tk

def take_screenshot():
    screenshot = pyautogui.screenshot()
    screenshot.save('screenshot.png')
    print("Screenshot taken and saved as 'screenshot.png'")

def toggle_always_on_top():
    root.attributes('-topmost', not root.attributes('-topmost'))

root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Screenshot Taker")

screenshot_button = tk.Button(root, text="Take Screenshot", command=take_screenshot)
screenshot_button.pack(padx=10, pady=5)

always_on_top_button = tk.Button(root, text="Toggle Always On Top", command=toggle_always_on_top)
always_on_top_button.pack(padx=10, pady=5)

root.mainloop()
This script creates a simple GUI with two buttons: one to take a screenshot and save it as 'screenshot.png' in the current directory, and another to toggle the window between always on top and normal behavior. You'll need to have the pyautogui library installed in your Python environment to use the screenshot functionality.
